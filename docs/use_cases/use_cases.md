### New Template

I want to create a new template standard layout with custom theme colors and font
Here are the colors x, y, z
Here is the font montserra, titles should be 30pt bold, body 20pt normal


### New Template with a title slide

We have the following image that we want to create a title slide with
I will tailor the layout I just need the template setup 
Here's the image
Here are the colors
Here are the fonts and sizes

### Fix an existing slide

We have an slide deck that looks good, but all of the layout is done locally on the slides and not in the template.
Can you extract the main colors, font and sizes, group by common layouts and colors and generate slide master templates appropriately
- Most common font / colors go to slide master
- Less common get created as slide layouts 
- Background images / colors / positions get migrated to slide layouts
